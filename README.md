# Interactive_Bayesian_Optimization_Research 

The repository includes the research being made on developing Interactive Bayesian optimization programs. It also includes the Julia simulations for the Agent-Based Models used for the case studies. 

At this point (March 2024) there is one folder for the initial development which is supplementary information for the IDETC 2024 submission. It includes it's own readme and documentation. The MATLAB code for this section is not generalized at this time and will Any changes made after the submission date of March 12th, 2024, are only on improving the documentation and in-code commenting to improve clarity.

Future work includes plans for a generalized n-dimensional Interactive Bayesian optimization with user feedback for constraining the feasible design space. 

Stay tuned!
